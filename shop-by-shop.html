<h2 class="h2-left">Acola Coffee Company</h2>
<h3 class="h3-left"><em>(Formerly Three Story Coffee)</em></h3>
<div class="acola">
<div class="acola-text">
<p>Acola Coffee Company, formerly known as Three Story Coffee, was inspired by three basic stories when you drink a cup of coffee: “Yours, ours, and the farmers.” Acola’s main goal is to bridge the gap between coffee growers and coffee drinkers.
<br>
They roast their coffee in batches of 18 pounds at a time south of town in Jefferson City, and then serve it up freshly brewed in a two-story building in the North Village Arts District. Here you will find a spacious dining area, more room to lounge up the stairs and a patio for those who like to take in the fresh air. So whatever seating arrangement is your poison, Acola has a place, and a drink for you to enjoy.</p>

  <div class="coffee-zone-text">
<p>Established in 1994, Coffee Zone is a spacious, warm and inviting location offering not only a variety of specialty espresso drinks, but also an extensive menu of light Mediterranean eats and pastries. So, whether you're looking to get your caffeine-fix for the day or craving an authentic taste of the Middle East, this place has got it all, including dessert, covered! One of the most unique offerings that tends to bring people back again and again is their Turkish coffee, made-to-order and served in its very own cezve, or small, long-handled pot specifically designed for the beverage. Coffee Zone is also home to 'Rocket Fuel,' a rich dark roast with an extra caffeine punch. </p>

<div class="fretboard">
  <div class="fretboard-text">
<p>Fretboard Coffee’s home base speaks volumes about the level of artistry in the shoppe. This shop was a dream created by a husband and wife duo from the East Coast who wanted to commit themselves to a fresh roastery, sustainability and community impact. Fretboard welcomes the community with unique flavors, open mic nights, and a coffee truck named “Marilyn.” It sources its coffee from ethical and organic growers, and that’s exactly the vibe a customer feels when they sit inside for a cup of coffee. Fretboard has one of the more limited, but also impressive menus on our list, boasting a variety of ways they brew up their beans for the Columbia community.</p>

    </div>
  <div class="lakota-text">
<p>Lakota Coffee Company is everything your average coffee drinker could want and need, and even more. The interior features natural brick walls with local artistry hanging on the walls, and if you time it just right, the aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans coming from the back of the store. With a classic downtown building feel, the shop is long and narrow, but has a fair amount of seating for those wanting to stay in with their drink and a line flow to help you get in and out when you're on the go. The menu features everything from hot to iced to blended, and there is even plenty to choose from for non-coffee drinkers as well, such as smoothies, hot cocoa and apple cider. And this location is not shy on accompaniments, boasting a menu of sandwiches and a case of pastries to pair with your beverage. The store also has a wall of coffee bean varieties to pick from and take home after your visit.</p>
